Pitfalls I encountered when setting up / updating my Hydrogen 2025.7.0 Storefront

-

on package.json
had to remove "dev": "react-router typegen --watch && shopify hydrogen dev --codegen", from dev build 

-

when updating, remove node-modules and .hydrogen and everything before doing it.
instructions come on .hydrogen folder

-

rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm cache clean --force
npm install

-

to set up authentication out of the box, get url from Settings > Customer Accounts > URL 
(ex. https://shopify.com/12345657736/account)
add this url to header sign in link

-

Follow step 1 and 2 of <https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/building-with-the-customer-account-api/hydrogen#step-1-set-up-a-public-domain-for-local-development>
